## Breaking Changes

-

## HotReload

The previous version introduced HotReload, enhancing the development experience when building the site locally. With
HotReload, every time you update your source code or .md file, BlazorStatic automatically refreshes the post list and
regenerates all content. Learn more about HotReload [here](docs/hotreload).
