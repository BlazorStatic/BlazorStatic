## Breaking changes:

- No property `BeforeFilesGenerationAction` in `BlazorStaticOptions` anymore. Use `BlazorStaticOptions.AddBeforeFilesGenerationFunc`
  (or `AddBeforeFilesGenerationAction` if you don't need async). Reason for this comes from internal handling of blog post parsing. 
  Blog posts parsing has no special property (`BlogAction`) now - it is handled by `AddBeforeFilesGenerationFunc`.
- Blog post are now parsed **after** the custom `beforeFilesGenearionAction` (that you might add via `opt.AddBeforeFilesGenerationFunc/Action`)
  If you need to parse the blog post first (and operate with them in `opt.AddBeforeFilesGenerationFunc/Action`), use new property `BlogOptions.IsParsingAsFirstAction`
