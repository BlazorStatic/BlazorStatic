# Blazor Static

Is a way how to use Blazor component model to scaffold static website with some helpers for making it pleasant experience.

Use standart way of creating and testing .NET8 Blazor app (server side rendered). When you are ready, add a little bit of magic to your `Program.cs` and the whole website will be generated as static html.

BlazorStatic will also help you with using Markdown for content you you wish to do it.

## How to start?

Multiple ways:

### BlazorStaticMinimalBlog

- Fork [link](https://github.com/tesar-tech/BlazorStaticMinimalBlog)
- Let it build and boom - you have your website up and running.
- Edit the content, change styling, configuration, etc.

### dotnet new
- Create Blazor App with `dotnet new blazor -o MyNewWebsite`
- Add `BlazorStatic` package to your project
- Add:
 
  ```csharp
  //Program.cs
  builder.Services.AddBlazorStaticServices<FrontMatter>(); 
  //...
  //before app.Run():
  app.UseBlazorStaticGenerator<FrontMatter>();
  ```
- Add content with markdown
- Change configuration that will suits your needs and folder structure.
- Delete `blazor.js` 
- All the default config is described here 



## Key features

- Create website with .NET 8, run it, test it, debug it as usual.
- Add a little bit of magic to your `Program.cs` and the whole website will be generated as static html.
- Use Markdown for content you you wish to do it. 
- Host static html on anywhere (GitHub Pages, Azure Static Web Apps, Netlify, ...)

## How it works?

- You work in the components, for example check the Blog.razor. It is using markdown file as a source of content.
You can use all the stuff like markwond settings, changing urls, etc in here.

We need the magic for few things:

- Generate static html from Blazor components
- Use Markdown

## Why TailwindCSS?

Because I like it. You don't have to use it. You can use any CSS framework you like, just like in any other Blazor app.

The theme is inspired by https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog
